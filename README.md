# Hello! I'm Lívia Adair Menato 👋

I am a **Systems Analysis and Development** student at **UNIFEOB**, with a growing passion for **back-end development**, especially with **Python**. 
My journey started in a very different field: I hold a degree in **Psychology** from the University of Beira Interior in Portugal, where I lived for 6 years. 
During that time, I worked with the university and participated in events like **Universidade de Verão**, along with other work experiences, such as being a waitress and working at a ski resort.

But it was in technology that I found a new path. After returning to Brazil, I started studying programming and I'm always seeking to learn more about **software development**.
